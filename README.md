# Pokemon Quiz Game

Welcome to the Pokemon Quiz Game! This is an interactive web-based guessing game where you can put your knowledge about Pokemon to the test. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Java Spring Boot, this game provides a clean user interface and seamless user experience.

## How The Game Works

At the start of the game, you will be presented with images of 10 different Pokemon. Your task is to guess the name of each Pokemon. You will have one attempt to correctly guess each Pokemon, so choose wisely! At the end of the game, your score will be calculated based on the number of correct guesses you made.
